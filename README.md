# Multi-Container App with Kubernetes on GKE
This project was created to implement Kubernetes applications with multi-containers. A React app and Fibonacci sequence calculation algorithm were developed and deployed on GKE. (It was prepared as a continuation of the Multi-Docker ElasticBeanstalk project. The project architecture is listed in the Project Structure section.)

CI/CD processes were managed using Github Actions.

The application is accessible via the domain names `ercankurtoglu.xyz` and `www.ercankurtoglu.xyz`, and HTTPS certificate settings have been configured.

| File | Description | Schema |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Old system architecture (Docker Container) | This project was previously prepared for deployment on AWS EBS using Travis-ci CI/CD with Docker Container. | [Goto Schema](https://github.com/ErcanKurtoglu/multi-k8s/blob/master/slides/old_system.pdf) |
| Project architecture | Multi-docker images were created and configured easily using Kubernetes. Nodes were created using object types like Ingress-nginx, Deployment, ClusterIP, and PVC. | [Goto Schema](https://github.com/ErcanKurtoglu/multi-k8s/blob/master/slides/project_architecture.pdf) |

### üîê 00. React Server

1. <u>Downloaded Node.js:</u>  

    Node.js was installed for Linux using `nvm` as the project was developed on a WSL system.  
    [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

    ![alt text](slides/img/{95DDBAEA-E7A5-4F76-B917-16FC328E39A8}.png)

2. <u>Created React app:</u>  

        npx create-react-app client

3. <u>Added Fib.js and Other.js:</u>  

    **Fib.js:** A page where the Fibonacci algorithm is executed. Users can input values to see the result, and all entered values are displayed on this page.  
    **Other.js:** An empty page.

### ![alt text](slides/img/o46jvwuf2.png) 01. Express Server
The Express Server acts as a communication bridge between Redis, Postgres, and the React App.

### ![alt text](slides/img/dhtnoalh.png) 02. Fibonacci
A server where the Fibonacci algorithm is executed. The application displays Fibonacci numbers up to 40.

### ![alt text](slides/img/260p99kt2.png) 03. Kubernetes
For both client and server services, 3 pods were created each, while other services have 1 pod each. Each service has a ClusterIP Service. Ingress-Nginx is configured for the entry traffic to the node.

For local development, use the [ingress-service-local-dev](https://github.com/ErcanKurtoglu/multi-k8s/blob/master/k8s_local_dev/ingress-service-local-dev.yaml) configuration file. Certificate, issuer, and ingress-service configuration files should not be used. Additionally, other configuration files inside the `k8s` folder should be applied.

Local development:  

    kubectl apply -f [yaml files]

For production, use the opposite configuration files. Necessary production setup is included in the Github Actions configuration file.

### ![alt text](slides/img/fpa0rfwt2.png) 04. Github Actions

Github Actions is where the CI/CD processes are managed. All operations are executed in two jobs: testing and deployment. Each pull request (PR) triggers the process, and automated tests are performed. If the tests pass successfully, automatic deployment is executed.

### ![alt text](slides/img/u7q072ec2.png) 05. Secrets

Sensitive data for the project is stored here. To add new secrets:  

    [Repo] -> Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Action -> New Repository secret

### ![alt text](slides/img/podz7i7h2.png) 06. GCP

The project was deployed on GCP.  
* After logging in, create a new project.  
* Link the project to a `Billing account`.  
* Configure necessary settings via Shell.  
* Create a secret for `Postgres` using Shell.  
* Create an `ingress-nginx controller` via Shell.  
* Create a `cert-manager` via Shell (for HTTPS certificates).  
* Configure DNS settings (if domain assignment is required).
